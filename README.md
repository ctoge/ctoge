# Christian Ona :3
## PhD Student in Plant Pathology at UC Riverside

Hi! My name is Christian Ona (He/Him). I am a PhD student in the (Stajich Lab)[https://lab.stajich.org/], focusing on extremeophilic and extremotolerant fungi such as *Rhodotorula* as a part of (ExFAB)[https://exfab.engineering.ucsb.edu/]. 

I did my undergraduate in Genetics at the University of Georgia, where I studied (fungal pathogens in peanuts)[https://fieldreport.caes.uga.edu/features/fungal-threats/] as part of my thesis.

I am interested in extreme and pathogenic fungi.
